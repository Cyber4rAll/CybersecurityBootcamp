                        A mandatory access control (MAC) policy is one that is <strong>uniformly enforced across all subjects and objects within the boundary of an information system</strong>. In simplest terms, <strong>this means that only properly designated security administrators, as trusted subjects, can modify any of the security rules</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        Although MAC sounds very similar to DAC, <strong>the primary difference is who can control access</strong>. With Mandatory Access Control, <strong>it is mandatory for security administrators to assign access rights or permissions</strong>; <strong>with Discretionary Access Control, it is up to the object owner’s discretion</strong>.

                        Role-based access control (RBAC), as the name suggests, sets up user permissions based on roles. Each role represents users with similar or identical permissions.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        Monitoring these role-based permissions is important, because if you expand one person’s permissions for a specific reason—say, a junior worker’s permissions might be expanded so they can temporarily act as the department manager—but you forget to change their permissions back, this can lead to <strong>privilege creep</strong> or <strong>permissions creep</strong>.
