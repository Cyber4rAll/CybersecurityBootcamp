Offering greater efficiency for traffic delivery and improving the overall throughput of data, switches are smarter than hubs, but not as smart as routers.</p>

                        A virtual local area network (VLAN) is a logical network that can group together devices from different physical networks. VLANs can be used to improve security by isolating network traffic and preventing attacks. Administration of the environment is simplified, as the VLANs can be reconfigured when individuals change their physical location or need access to different services.

                        VLANs do not guarantee a network’s security. At first glance, it may seem that traffic cannot be intercepted because communication within a VLAN is restricted to member devices. However, there are attacks that allow a malicious user to see traffic from other VLANs (so-called VLAN hopping). The VLAN technology is only one tool that can improve the overall security of the network environment.

                        Secure communications can, of course, be provided by the VPN, but only if the security protocols have been selected and correctly configured to provide a trusted path over an untrusted network, such as the internet. Remote users employ VPNs to access their organization’s network, and depending on the VPN’s implementation, they may have most of the same resources available to them as if they were physically at the office.
